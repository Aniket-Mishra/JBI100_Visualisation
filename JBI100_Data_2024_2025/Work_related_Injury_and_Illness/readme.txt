Injury Tracking Application (ITA) Data

The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires many (but not all) businesses to track employees’ work-related injuries and illnesses. Larger companies and those in high-risk industries must electronically submit annual counts to the agency. Thanks to freedom-of-information lawsuits by Reveal and Public Citizen, OSHA began to publish business-level data from those electronic submissions in 2020. The records, which go back to 2016, include each business’s name, location, industry, employee count, and employee hours worked, plus their reported number of deaths, injuries, skin disorders, respiratory conditions, poisonings, hearing loss, and other illnesses.
